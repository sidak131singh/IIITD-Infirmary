# Appointment Booking Fix - Summary

## Problem
The appointment booking functionality was not working end-to-end:
1. Book Appointment page was not submitting data to the API
2. Appointments page was showing mock/hardcoded data
3. Booked appointments were not saved to the database
4. Appointments were not reflected on the dashboard

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created GET Doctors API
**File:** `/app/api/doctors/route.ts`
- Fetches all doctors from the database
- Returns doctors with id, name, and email
- Used by the booking form to populate doctor dropdown

### 2. Updated Book Appointment Page
**File:** `/app/student/appointments/book/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed hardcoded mock doctors data
- Added `useEffect` to fetch real doctors from `/api/doctors`
- Implemented actual form submission to `POST /api/student/appointments`
- Added toast notifications for success/error messages
- Added loading states (fetching doctors, booking appointment)
- Changed time slots format to match API requirements (e.g., "9:00 AM - 9:30 AM")
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

**API Integration:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/student/appointments", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    doctorId: doctor,
    date: date.toISOString(),
    timeSlot: timeSlot,
    reason: reason,
  }),
})
```

### 3. Updated Appointments List Page
**File:** `/app/student/appointments/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed all hardcoded mock appointments
- Added `useEffect` to fetch real appointments from `/api/student/appointments`
- Implemented proper appointment filtering:
  - **Upcoming**: Future appointments with PENDING/CONFIRMED status
  - **Past**: Past appointments or COMPLETED/CANCELLED status
- Added cancel appointment functionality
- Proper date formatting using `date-fns`
- Loading skeleton states
- Toast notifications for actions

**Features Implemented:**
- Real-time data from database
- Cancel appointment button with confirmation
- Loading states for better UX
- Proper status badges with color coding:
  - CONFIRMED: Green
  - PENDING: Yellow
  - COMPLETED: Gray
  - CANCELLED: Red

### 4. Updated API Documentation
**File:** `STUDENT_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Added GET Doctors API documentation
- Updated numbering for all endpoints (1-10)
- Complete API reference for all student portal features

## Complete Flow Now Working

### Booking Flow:
1. Student navigates to **Book Appointment** page
2. System fetches available doctors from database
3. Student selects: Doctor, Date, Time Slot, Reason
4. On submit:
   - Data sent to `POST /api/student/appointments`
   - API validates all fields
   - Checks if time slot is available
   - Creates appointment with PENDING status in database
   - Returns success response
5. Student redirected to appointments page
6. Success toast notification shown

### Viewing Appointments:
1. Student navigates to **My Appointments** page
2. System fetches all appointments from database
3. Appointments automatically filtered into:
   - **Upcoming Tab**: Future appointments (not cancelled/completed)
   - **Past Tab**: Historical appointments
4. Each appointment shows:
   - Date and time
   - Doctor name
   - Reason
   - Status badge
   - Action buttons (Cancel for upcoming)

### Dashboard Integration:
1. Dashboard fetches next appointment via `/api/student/next-appointment`
2. Shows next upcoming appointment card with:
   - Date
   - Time slot
   - Doctor name
   - View Details button
3. Shows total appointment count via `/api/student/appointments/count`
4. Both widgets update automatically when new appointments are booked

## Database Tables Used

### Appointment Table (Prisma Schema)
```prisma
model Appointment {
  id          String            @id @default(cuid())
  date        DateTime
  timeSlot    String
  reason      String
  status      AppointmentStatus @default(PENDING)
  notes       String?
  
  studentId   String
  doctorId    String
  
  student     User @relation("StudentAppointments")
  doctor      User @relation("DoctorAppointments")
  
  prescription Prescription?
}
```

### Status Flow:
- **PENDING**: Initial status when booked
- **CONFIRMED**: Doctor confirms the appointment
- **COMPLETED**: Appointment finished
- **CANCELLED**: Student/Doctor cancelled

## API Endpoints Used

1. **GET /api/doctors** - Get available doctors
2. **POST /api/student/appointments** - Book new appointment
3. **GET /api/student/appointments** - Get all appointments
4. **PATCH /api/student/appointments/[id]** - Cancel appointment
5. **GET /api/student/next-appointment** - Get next upcoming appointment
6. **GET /api/student/appointments/count** - Get appointment statistics
